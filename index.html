        Instructions
        
        <div class="recipe-instruction">
            Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
            You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
        </div>
          
        <div class="recipe-instruction">
            Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
        </div>
        
        
        <div class="recipe-instruction">
          Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
          the eggs evenly coat the surface.
        </div>
          
        
        <div class="recipe-instruction">
          Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
          middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
        </div>
          
        
        <div class="recipe-instruction">

          Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
          fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
        </div>
        
        <div class="recipe-instruction">
          Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
